                around the definition of problems and the determination of objectives for decision-making, through
                creativity, innovation and lateral thinking along with digital tools, transforming them for proper
                interpretation. This activity helps in the optimization of graphic communications. It is also known as

                Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier
                and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is
                someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior design is a
                multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections,
                programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and
                execution of the design.

                Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured by mass
                production. It is the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features,
                which takes place in advance of the making of a product. In contrast, manufacture consists purely of
                repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based
                design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator largely concurrent with the
                act of its creation.

                Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to
                clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has varied over time
                and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and
                accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers. He or she can specialize in clothing, accessory, or
                jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these areas."
